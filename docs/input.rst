INPUT
=====
Proteomes downloaded from Uniprot (Plasmodium and Reference ensembles). Multifasta files.





Problems/Comments
=========
I see from MRF results (1b) that the ID was taken from the 1st item before the space in the fasta 1st line. 
For Uniprot, it could be good to leave just the Uniprot accession number. In case another input (ej NCBI, or other) is used, the 1st item could be another thing. In any case, for the instructions, it would be good to clarify to the user that the ID of the protein in the whole workflow is going to be the first word before the space. Consider warn this to the user in case they need to reformat the input before running.
